# Minecraft Classic Dumper
Thank you for choosing Minecraft Classic Dumper!

# How to use
**First of all make sure you have python installed.**
Then open your terminal and do this (Windows)
```cd [DIRECTORY WITH dump.py]```
Next, launch the file like this
```python dump.py```
It should show a disclaimer, agree to it to proceed.
It then should ask if you want the host.py file, I strongly reccomend this but its your choice.
Thats it for dumping it, just wait for it to finish.

# How to use the host.py file
Open your terminal and do this (Windows)
```cd [DIRECTORY WITH host.py]```
Then do this
```python host.py```
Your web browser should load up the page.
It is worth noting that its being hosted on port 8080
